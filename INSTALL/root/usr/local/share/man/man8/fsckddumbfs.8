.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBfsckddumbfs\fP [options] \fIparent\-directory\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBfsckddumbfs\fP check and repair a ddumbfs filesystem
.sp
The \fIparent\-directory\fP is the directory containing the \fIddfs.cfg\fP file and
\fIddfsroot\fP directory.
Operations inside the 
.nf
**
.fi
fsckddumbfs* process are done in a way that any
unexpected interruption can be repaired by re\-running the  same command.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show help message and exit.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Be more verbose. Be careful this can slow down the process when you are
working remotely through a slow link and that \fIfsckddumbfs\fP has a lot
of problem to display.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-progress
Display progress second by second of some part of the file system check.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-lock_index
Lock index into memory (increase speed)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-force
Bypass some guardrail.
Continue even if the \fIblock file\fP don\(aqt start with the appropriate
\fImagic\fP signature.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-check
Read\-only check. (very fast, only few seconds)
Search any conflicting information in the index and in the files nodes.
This is the right option to get an idea if their is any problem. To check
block hashes, use option \fB\-C\fP bellow.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-check\-block
read\-only check with block re\-hashing: (slow, depend of disk usage)
Search any conflicting information in the index and in the files nodes,
but also re\-hash all block referenced by the index and the files nodes.
This give you an exhaustive status of the filesystem.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-repair
Automatically repair. (fast, this is the \fBrecommended\fP option.)
Search any conflicting information in the index and in the files nodes
and fix them by calculating the blocks hashes when needed. Fix the index, and all
files nodes.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-repair\-relaxed
Automatically repair. (fastest, use it only if you understand what it does).
Identical to the \fI\-n\fP option above but don\(aqt check new entries from files.
This is useful if you have deleted your index and want to quickly rebuild it
from files nodes without re\-hashing blocks.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-rebuild
Rebuild a new index using only known used blocks. (slow, depend of disk usage)
Drop index and re\-hash all known used blocks to re\-build a new index
from scratch. Only blocks having a reference in files and in the used block
list are re\-hashed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-rebuild\-block
Rebuild a new index by re\-hashing all blocks. (slowest)
Drop index and re\-hash ALL blocks from the block file.
Use it if some files are \fIcorrupted\fP and you are desperate, maybe some
unallocated space in the block file could still contain the missing blocks.
Don\(aqt have too much hope.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-pack
Pack the \fIblockfile\fP. \fBWarning\fP, be sure to understand what it does
and what it implies before to use it.
.sp
This operation can slow down further sequential read of the existing data.
Further writes can be faster.
.sp
Blocks at the end of the \fIblockfile\fP will be moved at the beginning.
The \fIindex\fP and the \fIfiles\fP will be updated to match the new addresses
of the moved blocks. If the \fIblockfile\fP is a regular file, it will be
truncated to free unused space.
.sp
The filesystem must be clean, You must use it in combination with
switches \fI\-n\fP, \fI\-N\fP, \fI\-r\fP or \fI\-R\fP.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
Check ddumbfs filesystem located in \fI/l0/ddumbfs\fP. The read\-only check can
even be done on an online filesystem, but the result could be
inaccurate. To increase speed, use \fI\-l\fP to lock the index in memory.:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fsckddumbfs \-c \-l /l0/ddumbfs
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Repair an offline ddumbfs filesystem located in \fI/l0/ddumbfs\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fsckddumbfs \-n \-l /l0/ddumbfs
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Every fix is logged in the log file (here in \fI/l0/ddumbfs/.ddumbfs/ddumbs.log\fP)
and corrupted files are logged in file \fI/l0/ddumbfs/.ddumbfs/corrupted.txt\fP.
